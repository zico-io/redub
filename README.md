# Redub

# Overview

## Goal
Streamline the logistical side of music production.

# Exploration
## **Problem 1:** Collaboration
Time and resources are wasted attempting to coordinate and collaborate, particularly now in an era where most music production takes place remotely.

*"How do we streamline the exchange of feedback and revisioning?"*
* **Version Control**
* **Profiles**
* **Commenting**

## **Problem 2:** Organization
Organization across teams quickly gets messy, automate the processes involved to enable team members painless sharing of data and documents.

*"How can we maintain a functional and efficient space for project housing?"*
* **Storage**
* **Metadata**
* **Project Management**

## **Problem 3:** Utilization
The post-release process has too many barriers that prevent artists/studios from effectively marketting their material.

*"How do we maximize each release and avoid orphaned projects?"*
### Pre-Launch
* **Checklist**
* **Crediting**
* **Delivery**
### Post-Launch
* **'Link-in-Bio'**
* **Data Collection**
* **Data Analysis**

# Implementation
## Collaboration
Throughout the entire process from inception to release, it's important to thouroughly document the changes and contributions members make towards a project, as well as ensuring teams have the ability to revert to previous project states so we can encourage experimentation during the creative process.
To achieve this, we can implement a version control system for files within projects. 

### Projects
Upon creation of a new project, the user who instantiated the project (along with any studio administrators) will have full control over said project. This user, (Hereinafter referred to as 'Project Manager'), will be able to invite collaborators to work on the project, as well as control the permissions these collaborators have within the project. Setting this up on both 'Individual' and 'Group' levels will allow for quick onboarding of new collaborators as the project grows. Want to invite someone to listen to the project without including them as a collaborator? Through the use of link-sharing and/or password protection, you'll be able to share the current state of the project to an unregistered user who can also leave time-stamped feedback throughout the project.  
**(NOTE: Comments left by non-collaborators will NOT be documented in the CREDITS section of the project data)**

### Tracks
Each project consists of one or more 'Tracks', with each track having its' own versioning history and associated documentation. Beyond the initial upload of a track, while not strictly necessary, it is good practice to include a short description of the changes made between versions when uploading a new version of the track. It is also encouraged to upload a current snapshot of the relevant project file (where applicable) in order to easily return to that project state for any necessary adjustments. This allows for relatively painless documentation of adjustments done by artists/engineers.
#### Useful Features
* The ability to A/B test different snapshots of a track
* Manual and/or automated gain matching of tracks within a project
* Turn comments into a form of "Issue Tracking" for more sophisticated/complex changes **(NOTE: Unsure how necessary this is)**

### Profiles
Every collaborator will have their own profile, within which studio-relevant information such as 'Position', in addition to individual-relevant information such as 'Socials' and 'Contact Info', will be stored. With each user having their unique profile, this will enable us to easily document who has worked on what, as well as easy access to information that will be useful in the later stages of a project (e.g. writing social media handles and/or professional contact information into the CREDITS section).
